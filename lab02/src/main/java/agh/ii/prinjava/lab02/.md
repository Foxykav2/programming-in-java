___
##### Final variables, methods, and classes
___
**2)** the benefit of a constante variable is that it does't mouve, it stay the same


**3)** 

Final in:

- local varial: a constant declared inside a a

- instance variable: a constant declared inside a class

- static constante : a constant declared as static

- method:A final method cannot be overridden by any subclass

classes:A class that is declared final cannot be subclassed.

**4)**

a) yes, we can't get access of any parameters of this class

b)yes as long as all the element are private with no setter, the class is immuable.

**5)**
the class is not immutable because we set a private value
but we can access to it by another public method,so there is nothing private in this class

6)....

##### Enmeration classes (en\ms

---
**4)**

" An enum declaration specifies a new enum class, a restricted kind of class that defines a small set of named class instances.
An enum class is implicitly final "

in this example , we can set an enum in public, it meen that is no longeur final
this is not correct.

"It is a compile-time error if the same keyword appears more than once as a modifier for an enum declaration, or if an enum declaration has more than one of the access modifiers public,"

the example is not thrad free.

---
##### Nested classes

---

**2)**
 there are multiple nested classes:

-a static member class : this class doesn't have access to the outter classes.

-an inner class, which may be:

- a non-static member class/inner Class: those classes can acess to outer classes.

- a local class:a nested class whose declaration is contained by a block;
typically, in the body of a method

- an anonymous class:  an inner class with no name

**3)**

Can an inner class be used in a class other than the class in which it nests?

no, the inner class exit whitin the outter class.To use it, we must use the outer classe like:
 
```` OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass()````

Can the modifiers public, protected, private, and static be used for inner classes?

yes exept static because an inner class is associated with an instance, it cannot define any static members itself.

---
##### Abstract Data Types (abstract classes and interfaces)

---

**2)**

abstact and interfaces have multiple diff√©renses like :

- inheritence : in interface , we can implement an interface with multiple inheritence, abstract class can't.


**3)**
...

**4)**

corect answer 

``abstract class E { abstract void m1(); }``

**5)**

corect answer 

``interface D { void m1(); }``

**6)**

````interface A {}
class C {}
class D extends C {}
class B extends D implements A {}

public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
B b = new B();
if (b instanceof A)
System.out.println("b is an instance of A");
if (b instanceof C)
System.out.println("b is an instance of C");
}
}
````

the output will be "b is an instance of A" because B implements A so the condition id true.

But B extend D not C, even if C and D are the same, it will be false.

---
#####  Functional interfaces and lambda expressions

---

**2)**

functional interfaces has exactly ONE abstract method and landa function are a conviniente way to crete anonymous function.

those paire up quite well since we need a interface with only on function and no implementation.

**3)**

``interface test1 {
void apply(int x);
}
``

``interface test2 {
int apply(void x);
}
``

``interface test3 {
int apply(int x);
}
``

``interface test4 {
void apply(int x, int y);
}
``

##### Mini project 02_01 (exc02_01)

---

all the task as been realised but for my project i enconter a big probleme.

i could't make work the ArrayBasedImpl in time. I still documented my program to see the idea behind it .
