Exercice 1)
the encapsulation have many définition:
-bundling together of publicly accessible methods and privately accessible data
-data hiding (controversial, see link below)
-controlled access to the object properties
its implemented with simple word
public
private
static
protected

(with my word) the encapsulation is an state that define a variable, somtimes we want a variable to be public somtimes not

2) 
 the setter is a fonction in a class who set the parameter 
the getter is use to get a certain parameter
3) "this" is a parameter that can be only use by non static function. he traduce somme request for the constructor

"super " is...

4) inheritence is Inheritance (implementation/code inheritance, in C++ private inheritance
        is a form of code reuse
with the word "extend" a class can inherite fonction from an other class
if we want to modify a méthode , use override

5) there is différente type of polymorphisime :

-ad-hoc polymorphism (overloading of operators, functions, or - as in Java - methods)
-subtype/inclusion polymorphism (in this example)
-parametric polymorphism (Java Generics)

(with my word) polymorphisime is a manner to programme that want to use something with multiple forme.
ex: a function can target multiple class or constructor can have mulitiple form

8) for the encaspsulation :

   void setUp() {
   int C2;
   HelloEncapsulation C1 = new HelloEncapsulation(55);
   C1.setPropVal(33);
   C2 = C1.getPropVal();
   System.out.println(C2);
   }




   
Exercice 2

1) A static variable (can be seen in Java as a class variable) is shared by all objects of the class 
Static variables are initialized when class is loaded (so <i>only once</i> per class, 
before any object of that class is created) 
static constants = static final variables; they are quite common 
(in contrast to mutable static variables)


A common use for static methods is a factory method - a static method that returns new instances of the class 
(presented in the next section) 
Static methods are methods that do not operate on objects (they do not receive an implicit first argument)

2)a static variable is shared by all object of the class, so it can be usefull to change it and modifie the comportement of a class

Exercice 3

1) ...







Exercice 4

1)An immutable object is an object whose internal state remains constant after it has been entirely created.

2)...



3) immutable data/objects can be shared without risk

4)<li>the appropriate accessors 
-constructor
-equals method
-hashCode method
-toString method


5)...





Exercice 5
"==" compare two parameter but on the surface if we compare two object, it will only compare the name

equals , comapre more depplie, if two object are the same, it will be true
